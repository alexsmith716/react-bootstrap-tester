# isomorphic-react-bootstrap-sass-loader

### Overview
Implementing isomorphic react with react-bootstrap and bootstrap-sass-loader.

Also, testing webpack, Babel and more.

OK, I finally feel I have a working understanding of how webpack, Babel and transpiling work together.

At least good enough for now. Removed bootstrap-loader in favor of just bootstrap-sass.

When conversion from bootstrap-loader to bootstrap-sass is done (today/tomorrow) then straight to full-time React.
